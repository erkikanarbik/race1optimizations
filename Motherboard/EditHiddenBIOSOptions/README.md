### MAXIMUS VIII HERO ASUS BIOS Version 3802

## GRUB Guide
 * Download your bios version from website and open with [UEFITool](https://github.com/LongSoft/UEFITool/releases)
 * Use search "high precision" to find where bios settings are hidden and "Extract as is..."
 * Load with [IRFExtractor](http://bios-mods.com/pub/donovan6000/Software/Universal%20IFR%20Extractor/Universal%20IFR%20Extractor.exe) and extract
 * Rename output file to a.txt and [IFR Formatter](https://github.com/BoringBoredom/IFR-Formatter) on it
 * Download [modGRUBShell.efi](https://github.com/datasone/grub-mod-setup_var/releases) put to formatted FAT32 USB in folder BOOT\EFI (make these manually)
 * Set bios to UEFI, disable secure boot and boot from USB (Should booting from USB not work, boot to EFI Shell from Bios)
 * EFI shell will open. Select your flash drive (I need to type fs7:). You will see from the list which one  it is.
 * Type CD BOOT\EFI; then type bootx64.efi
 * GRUB will open - here you can edit any offset from IRF Formatter output.
 * Use the following command: setup_var offset [value] [variable name]
 * Type reboot when done
 * Refer to datasone github if you have issues

# Example to enable TPM support

          Disabled: 0x0 (default)
          Enabled: 0x1

setup_var 0x24 0x1
