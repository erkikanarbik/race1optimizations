NOTE: This is an early access release for advanced users. If you are not comfortable with installing Windows, updating drivers, using the device manager, changing the registry, or debugging on your own, do not install it. Much more is planned for future versions, and there will be bugs along the way. Have a backup plan or alternate boot drive in place before installing.
